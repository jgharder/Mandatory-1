        <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p class="readable-text-size"> JavaScript is the language that Node.js is using. So to be able to make good Node.js projects we need to know JavaScript  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Data types</h4>
    <p class="readable-text-size">
Here are a few of the mos common Data types in JavaScript
        <pre class="pre">
    Numbers: 5, 11, 200
    String: "Hello World!"
    Boolean: can be true or false
    Null: null
    Undefined: a variable that has not been assigned a value
    Object: {}
    Array: []</pre>
     </p>
     <br>
     <h4>Variables
     </h4>

     <p class="readable-text-size">
         We have 3 different variables in JavaScript
         <pre class="pre">
    var
    let
    const</pre>
Var is generally not used anymore, as it was a global variable. And not scope dependent. This could create problems, if you were not 100% sure of what you are doing.
Let is used to declare variables at block scope. Let is used when the variable is going to be reassigned
<br> Const is used when you want to declare a variable that is not going to be reassigned. It's also block scope. 
<br> Use const as a default, when declaring variables.
     </p>
<br>
<h4>Spread operater (...)</h4>
<p class="readable-text-size">
    Spread operater is used when you want to copy or insert new data in to an existing variable.
    <pre class="pre">
    [...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]; 
    // combine two arrays by inserting all elements from iterableObj</pre>
</p>
